Plan a Python program.

Consider the program file @ngram.py It produces a list of
N-grams (of order N) from a text file.
Plan the design of a python program that takes the output of ngram.py 
as its input and generates random output where the ngrams in the 
output have the same relative frequency as in the input file.
The program should preferably deduce the order (N) of the input by
itself by inspecting its input. The program should take a 
numeric argument from the command line that specifies how many 
(words, characters?) it should generate before stopping.

Do not write any code yet, just do the planning.
Ask me for any additional details if needed.
